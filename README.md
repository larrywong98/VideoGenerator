# CSCI576 Multimudia Systems Design Final Project
- TODO: 
  - detect colors
  - cut video in shots to remove unrelative ads/insert corresponding ads
  
- Problems to be solved
  - hue varies too much, cannot detect under different sunlight/detect wrong color
  - when two brands have similar hue, cannot distinguish the correct one (potential sol: vote OR bitwiseAND)
  - video frame and timestamps synchronize, a little higher fps to maintain 30 fps
