**Description:**
This program will analyze the video frames to see if any known brands exist. If a known brand is detected, it will create a rough outline/box in the frames that it appears, and replace the following next advertisement with the given brand advertisement. MyPlayer will synchronize the video and audio rendering based on the video frame rate and the audio sampling rate.
